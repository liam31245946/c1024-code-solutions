## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `event.target`?
  property of an event object that refers to the element that triggered the event
- What is the effect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  element will be hidden from the page.
- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  to check if an element would be selected by a given CSS selector
- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  getAttribute()
- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  Start by logging at the beginning of your code to confirm it’s running as expected. As you retrieve user input or element values, log these to ensure you’re working with the correct data.
- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  you would need to write specific event listeners for each tab individually in TypeScript
- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  you would manually set each view's visibility within each tab's event listener
