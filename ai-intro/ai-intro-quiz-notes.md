## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  No, Because there are specific instruction or idea that only human can come up with. AI can code but certain cannot fully replicate human's intelligence

AI is transforming many aspects of software development, but it’s unlikely to fully replace developers anytime soon. Instead, AI can enhance their work by automating repetitive tasks, suggesting code, and assisting with debugging. Developers will still be needed for creativity, complex problem-solving, and understanding user needs. The role may evolve, focusing more on overseeing AI tools and integrating them into larger projects. So, while AI will change how developers work, it won’t make them obsolete.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  I would use ai to answer about how to use certain/specific syntax as well as provide me with example, I could also ask the ai to explain to me how the syntax work.

Using AI tools can greatly enhance your learning experience in software development. Here are some effective ways to leverage them:

Code Assistance: Use AI-powered code completion tools (like GitHub Copilot) to help write code snippets and learn best practices as you go.

Debugging Help: When you encounter errors, AI tools can assist in diagnosing issues and suggesting fixes, helping you understand common pitfalls.

Resource Recommendations: AI can suggest relevant tutorials, documentation, and resources based on your current learning topic or problem.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  I will grow dependence on the ai and instead of learning I would just be copy and paste

Chatgpt
While AI tools can be incredibly helpful, there are some potential dangers to be aware of as you learn software development:

Over-Reliance: Relying too heavily on AI can prevent you from fully understanding the underlying concepts and logic of programming. It’s important to engage with the material yourself.

Shallow Learning: If you use AI tools to generate code without understanding how it works, you might miss out on learning fundamental skills that are essential for problem-solving.
