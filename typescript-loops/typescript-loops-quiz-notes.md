## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  to be able to execute a block of code multiple time.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  to determine when the loop need to be stop
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Each time the loop completes its block of code and goes back to check the condition again, that’s one iteration
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  the condition expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  evaluated only once, at the very beginning of the loop, before any iterations start
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  the condition expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  the final expression is evaluated at the end of each iteration of the loop, right after the loop body has executed and before the condition is checked again for the next iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break exits a loop immediately, regardless of whether the loop’s condition expression is still true
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The ++ increment operator increases the value of a variable by 1
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  we can use the turn in loop
